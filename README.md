**How’s Today?** is a lightweight communication tool designed for people living with chronic illnesses (such as Long COVID, ME/CFS, and POTS) and their caregivers.

When energy is low, explaining "how you feel" can be an impossible task. This app replaces long texts and overwhelming questions with a **one-tap status signal**, making communication humane for those who cannot afford the cognitive load.

## 🕊️ Our Philosophy: "Depletion-Aware Design"
Traditional health trackers are often too loud, too complex, and too demanding. We follow a strict set of rules to protect our users:

* **Zero Typing:** Patients should never have to use a keyboard.
* **Zero Guilt:** No streaks, no "completion" bars, and no pressure to "log data."
* **One Daily Ritual:** A single status update that takes less than 10 seconds.
* **Compassionate Minimalism:** If a feature increases cognitive load, it doesn't belong here.

## 🛠️ MVP Focus
We are currently focusing on the core "Patient-to-Caregiver" loop:
* **Patient Side:** One-tap status updates and quick-tap "Needs" (e.g., "Quiet environment," "Help with meals").
* **Caregiver Side:** A gentle, real-time status card and a simple history timeline.
* **Shared:** Simple, private account linking via code.

**What we are NOT building:**
To protect the "lightness" of the app, we are intentionally avoiding medical analytics, charts, medication management, or complex messaging.
